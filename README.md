  <strong>Team LazyGo</strong> is a robotics team from <strong>Bangladesh</strong>. Originally formed in 2022, LazyGo won <strong>Bronze</strong> at the WRO international round in the Future Engineers category. Now returns again with three experienced international participants.
<br><br>

We named our robot **LazyBot**, which is built for the **Future Engineers** category in the **World Robot Olympiad 2025**. This year, we are trying to bring some interesting changes from the typical way a robot is built for this category. This repository contains all the files, codes, models, photos and everything about our team and the robot.

## Key Features

- **`Hybrid LEGO & 3D Printed Design`**: Using LEGO parts proved to be very helpful based on the previous experience of our members. That, along with 3D printed parts made it possible to harness LEGO's precision and the flexibility of 3D printing.
- **`Advanced Sensor Suite`**: LazyBot is equipped with a LiDAR (to perfectly sense the sorroundings), encoder motor (to precisely calculate the position), IMU (to calculate realtime orientation).
- **`Use of Robot Operating System`**: We used ROS2 to control the robot. We took this decision because Robot Operating System allows to make a project very modular and provide a lot of useful tools for simulation and visualization.
- **`Real-Time Odometry Calculation`**: This is one of the major feature of pur robot. Using the onboard IMU sensor and the value from the motor's encoder, the robot calculates the exact realtime position of the robot.
- **`Efficient Debugging`**: We've added an OLED display to the MCU of the robot which helps to debug the issues on the MCU side. And ROS2 provides with a lot of debugging tools that helps us debug any issues hapening on the Pi side.

# Mobility Management

This segment outlines the mobility system of **LazyBot**, with two key features: a differential gear system, and ackermann steering.

---

### **Differential Drive System**

Our robot utilizes a differential gear system powered by one **20GA DC gear motor with encoders** and a **3rd generation LEGO differential**, allowing the wheels on the same axle to rotate at different speeds even though they are both connected toa single motor. This is crucial feature for smooth cornering and precise movement.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

#### How It Works:
- The motor is connected to the differential gearset. The gear system distributes torque to the wheels as needed.
- The differential automatically compensates for wheel speed differences when turning.
- Encoders provide real-time feedback to ensure accurate speed and distance tracking.

#### Benefits:
1. **Smooth Turning**: Independent wheel speeds allow efficient navigation.
2. **Precise Odometry**: Encoders enhance path planning and tracking.
3. **Compact & Modular**: LEGO-based integration makes the drivetrain easy to modify or maintain.

### **Steering System - 3D Printed Ackermann Mechanism**

The robot features a **3D printed Ackermann steering system** controlled by a **servo motor**. This configuration allows the front wheels to turn at appropriate angles during a corner, minimizing tire slippage and improving real-world steering accuracy.

##### Advantages:
1. **Realistic Geometry**: Replicates automotive-grade steering for smoother and more stable turns.
2. **Customizable Design**: 3D printed components allow fine-tuning and easy iteration.
3. **Precise Control**: Servo-driven mechanism ensures consistent and accurate angle adjustments.
4. **Mechanical Efficiency**: Reduces energy loss and component wear during turning.

### **Motor Driver - VNH2SP30**

To control the high-current 20GA motor, we use the **VNH2SP30 full-bridge motor driver**. It allows for bidirectional motor control and supports high current output with excellent thermal performance.

##### Features:
- **High Power Handling**: Supports up to 30A peak, suitable for robust DC motor.
- **PWM Support**: Allows smooth speed control using ESP32 PWM signals.
- **Thermal Shutdown & Protection**: Keeps the system safe during heavy load.

---


### Summary

The first version of LazyBot features a simple yet effective mobility system combining:
- **Differential drive** with encoder feedback for stable movement.
- **VNH2SP30 motor driver** for high-efficiency control.

This configuration allowed us to build a robust platform capable of handling the dynamic challenges of autonomous navigation in the WRO Future Engineers category.

## Camera Placement and Functionality

The robot's main camera is positioned at the top and angled slightly downwards. This setup enhances object detection capabilities by providing:
- **Close-Range Detection**: The camera can identify objects in close proximity with high accuracy.
- **Extended-Range Detection**: Ensures objects further away are detected effectively.

The camera feeds data to the **Raspberry Pi 5**, which processes image recognition algorithms to detect towers and corner lines. The processed data is then transmitted to the **ESP32 microcontroller** for real-time navigation and obstacle avoidance.
