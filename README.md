- **üîç Close-Range Detection**: The camera can identify objects in close proximity with high accuracy.
- **üåê Extended-Range Detection**: Ensures objects further away are detected effectively.

The camera feeds data to the **Raspberry Pi 5**, which processes image recognition algorithms to detect towers and corner lines. The processed data is then transmitted to the **ESP32 microcontroller** for real-time navigation and obstacle avoidance.
